## Overview

![Preview](/assets/og_collage.png "Preview Collage")

This was my first "larger" App during studying.
It dates back to around early 2018 under usage of Android Studio 3.0/3.1.

Thematically the App works with the Camera. You can take a picture or choose one from external storage,
it then will be loaded into an Editor where you can apply various filters, polaroid-like backgrounds
and a capture text before saving it to external storage.

## Plans

- [ ] (update make project runnable under modern versions of the IDE)
- [ ] (turn project from View based to Compose system)
- [ ] (update camera implementations to using CameraX)
- [ ] (migrate still relevant code to kotlin)
- Add more Features?
