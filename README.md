> ðŸš§ **Old-Source-Code:** This App will be modernized in the future. For further plans check below.

See [Releases](https://github.com/rauschdo/photoapp/releases) for APK.<br/>

## Overview

![Preview](/assets/og_collage.png "Preview Collage")

This was my first "larger" App during studying.
It dates back to around early 2018 under usage of Android Studio 3.0/3.1.

Thematically the App works with the Camera. You can take a picture or choose one from external storage,
it then will be loaded into an Editor where you can apply various filters, polaroid-like backgrounds
and a capture text before saving it to external storage.

## Plans

Even though this project could be setup fresh with compose directly, intention is here to go step by step and modernize along the way.
Therefore checkboxes below do not represent a order in any way

- [ ] (update make project runnable under modern versions of the IDE)
- [ ] (turn project from View based to Compose system)
- [ ] (update camera implementations to using CameraX)
- [ ] (migrate still relevant code to kotlin)
- Add more Features?
